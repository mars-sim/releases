The Mars Simulation Project can be configured by editing the 
XML files in the 'conf' subdirectory.  You can then select the "New"
option in the project menu to start a new simulation that uses the 
edited configuration.

It is recommended that you make a backup of the original configuration
file before editing it as XML errors in the file can cause the program
to fail.
