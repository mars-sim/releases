<H2>Resupply Tool</H2>
<P>The Resupply Tool displays information about incoming and arrived resupply missions from Earth, and allows you to modify 
resupply missions or create new ones.</P>
<P>The Incoming Resupplies list shows all incoming resupply missions that have not arrived from Earth yet.  The destination 
settlement name and arrival time are shown for each resupply mission.  Selecting a resupply mission on the list will display
the mission's details in the Resupply Mission panel.</P>
<P>The Arrived Resupplies list shows all resupply missions that have already arrived from Earth.  The destination settlement 
name and arrival time are shown for each resupply mission.  Selecting a resupply mission on the list will display
the mission's details in the Resupply Mission panel.</P>
<P>The Resupply Mission panel shows information about the selected resupply mission.</P>
<P>The top panel shows the mission's destination settlement, its current state ("planned", "in transit", "delivered", or 
"canceled"), its arrival date, the time until arrival, and the number of immigrants arriving with the supplies.</P> 
<P>The Supplies panel shows tables of all buildings, vehicles, equipment, resources, and parts that are included in the resupply 
mission.  The supply tables include the supply type and the number.  The resource supply table shows the amount of each resource 
in kilograms.</P>
<P>The buttons at the bottom of the resupply tool include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>New - Opens a dialog to create a new resupply mission.</LI>
<LI>Modify - Opens a dialog to modify the selected resupply mission.  This is only available for incoming resupply missions, not ones
that have already arrived at their destinations.</LI>
<LI>Cancel - Cancels the selected resupply mission.  This is only available for incoming resupply missions, not ones that have already 
arrived at their destinations.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The "Create New Resupply Mission" and "Modify Resupply Mission" dialogs appear when you press the "New" or "Modify" buttons at the 
bottom of the resupply tool.  They are essentially the same except that the modify dialog is already populated with the resupply mission
information from the selected resupply mission.</P>
<P>The Destination combo box allows you to select a destination settlement that the mission will arrive at.</P>
<P>The Arrival Date panel allows you to select when the resupply mission is targeted to arrive.  The Arrival Date radio button allows you
to select the arrival date from a list of Sol, Month, and Orbit combo boxes.  The Sols Until Arrival radio button allows you to enter the
number of Sols until the mission arrives.</P>
<P>The Number of Immigrants text field lets you enter the number of new people arriving from Earth with the resupply mission.</P>
<P>The Supplies panel contains a table of all supplies in the mission.  The table shows the category, type, and number/amount of each
supply.  The Add button at the bottom will add a new supply item to the table.  The Remove button will remove a selected supply item
from the table.  Any of the table fields can be edited to change a supply items values.</P>
<P>The Modify button at the bottom of the dialog will commit the modifications to the resupply mission and close the dialog.</P>
<P>The Cancel button at the bottom of the dialog will cancel the modifications to the resupply mission and close the dialog.</P>
