<H2>Settlement Map Tool</H2>
<P>The Settlement Map Tool displays a top-down view of settlements with the layout of their buildings.</P>
<P>You can select which settlement you want to view from the drop-down list. The map can be zoomed in and 
out with the zoom slider, and rotated right or left with the rotate buttons. The settlement map can moved 
around by mouse dragging.  The Recenter button will reset the map at the settlement's center, default 
zoom, and rotation. The Labels button toggles the display of building name labels, and the Open Info button 
opens up the settlement info window for the currently selected settlement.</P>
