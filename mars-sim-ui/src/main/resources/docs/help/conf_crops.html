<P>The crops.xml configuration file contains configuration for crops that can be grown by people
 in greenhouse buildings. New types of crops can be added here.</P>
<P>Crops in a greenhouse are randomly selected from the "crop-list".</P>
<P>Each "crop" element has a unique name attribute. The "growing-time" attribute is the amount of time (sols) 
 (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>) between when a crop is planted and when it is ready for harvest.</P>
