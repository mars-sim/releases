<H2>construction.xml</H2>
<P>The construction.xml configuration file contains configuration for building construction stages.  Construction stages
can be added, edited, or deleted.</P>
<P>The "foundation-list" element contains multiple "foundation" elements that represent a foundation construction stage.
A "foundation" element contains the following attributes: "name", "constructable", "salvagable", "work-time", and 
"skill-required".  The "name" attribute has to be a unique name for the stage.  The "constructable" attribute is true if 
the foundation can be constructed and false if not.  The "salvagable" attribute is true if the foundation can be salvaged
and false if not.  The "work-time" attribute is the total amount of effective work time (millisols) 
(See <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>) required to complete the foundation construction.  The "skill-required" attribute 
is the minimum construction skill required for an architect to start the foundation construction mission.</P>
<P>The "foundation" element contains the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>resource:</B> Each "resource" element represents a type of resource needed to construct the foundation.  The "resource" 
element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource (See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">resources.xml</A>).  The 
"amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the resource (kilograms) needed.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>part:</B> Each "part" element represents a type of part needed to construct the foundation.  The "part" element has a 
"name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).  
The "number" attribute is the number of parts required.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>vehicle:</B> Each "vehicle" element represents a construction vehicle needed to construct the foundation.  The "vehicle" 
element has a "type" attribute that must match up to a vehicle type listed in the conf/vehicles.xml file (See 
<A HREF="conf_vehicles.html">vehicles.xml</A>).<BR><BR>
The "vehicle" element can contain a list of "attachment-part" child elements that represents attachment parts needed by
the vehicle.  Each "attachment-part" element as a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml 
file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The "frame-list" element contains multiple "frame" elements that represent a frame construction stage.
A "frame" element contains the following attributes: "name", "constructable", "salvagable", "work-time", and "skill-required".  
The "name" attribute has to be a unique name for the stage.  The "constructable" attribute is true if 
the frame can be constructed and false if not.  The "salvagable" attribute is true if the frame can be salvaged
and false if not.  The "work-time" attribute is the total amount of effective work time (millisols)
(See <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>) required to complete the frame construction.  The "skill-required"
attribute is the minimum construction skill required for an architect to start the frame construction mission.</P>
<P>The "frame" element contains the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>resource:</B> Each "resource" element represents a type of resource needed to construct the frame.  The "resource" 
element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource (See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">resources.xml</A>).  The 
"amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the resource (kilograms) needed.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>part:</B> Each "part" element represents a type of part needed to construct the frame.  The "part" element has a 
"name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).  
The "number" attribute is the number of parts required.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>vehicle:</B> Each "vehicle" element represents a construction vehicle needed to construct the frame.  The "vehicle" 
element has a "type" attribute that must match up to a vehicle type listed in the conf/vehicles.xml file (See 
<A HREF="conf_vehicles.html">vehicles.xml</A>).<BR><BR>
The "vehicle" element can contain a list of "attachment-part" child elements that represents attachment parts needed by
the vehicle.  Each "attachment-part" element as a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml 
file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The "building-list" element contains multiple "building" elements that represent a building construction stage.
A "building" element contains the following attributes: "name", "constructable", "salvagable", "work-time", and "skill-required".  
The "name" attribute has to be a unique name for the stage.  The "constructable" attribute is true if 
the building can be constructed and false if not.  The "salvagable" attribute is true if the building can be salvaged
and false if not.  The "work-time" attribute is the total amount of effective work time (millisols)
(See <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) required to complete the building construction.  The "skill-required"
attribute is the minimum construction skill required for an architect to start the building construction mission.</P>
<P>The "building" element contains the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>resource:</B> Each "resource" element represents a type of resource needed to construct the building.  The "resource" 
element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource (See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">resources.xml</A>).  The 
"amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the resource (kilograms) needed.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>part:</B> Each "part" element represents a type of part needed to construct the building.  The "part" element has a 
"name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).  
The "number" attribute is the number of parts required.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>vehicle:</B> Each "vehicle" element represents a construction vehicle needed to construct the building.  The "vehicle" 
element has a "type" attribute that must match up to a vehicle type listed in the conf/vehicles.xml file (See 
<A HREF="conf_vehicles.html">vehicles.xml</A>).<BR><BR>
