<P>The minerals.xml configuration file contains configuration for mineral concentrations that can be mined by 
 settlers. Mineral concentrations can be added, edited, or deleted.</P>
<P>A "mineral" element has the following attributes: "name" and "frequency". The 
 "name" attribute has to be a unique name for the mineral. The "frequency" attribute is how common the concentrations are
 for this mineral type. Valid values are "common", "uncommon", "rare" or "very rare".</P>
<P>The "mineral" element has the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>locale-list:</B> This is a list of locales where the mineral concentrations are located. The locale-list element is required, but there
  can be zero to many child locale elements. If there are zero locale elements, the mineral concentrations are randomly distributed about the planet.
    <UL>
      <LI><B>locale:</B> The locale element represents a topographical region that mineral concentrations are located. It has a "name" attribute and the 
 following locale names are currently supported: "volcanic", "sedimentary", and "crater".</LI>
