<P>The equipment box shows the number of particular equipment the person is carrying.</P>
<P><B>Natural Attributes -</B> The attributes tab panel shows the person's natural attributes.</P>
<P>Attributes are randomly determined and affect how well a person performs certain tasks.</P>
<P>Natural attribute definitions:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Strength - upper-body strength
  <LI>Endurance - cardiovascular endurance
  <LI>Agility - quickness and balance

<P>Skills may effect a person's ability to perform particular tasks.</P>
<P>A person starts with a random set of skills (possibly none).  When a person performs a task, he/she gains experience in the skill(s) 
  associated with the task.  When the experience in a skill passes a threshold, the skill level increases.  The threshold for each skill 
  doubles for each successive skill level, making it more difficult to reach higher levels.</P>
<P>More skills will be added later.</P>
<P><B>Activity -</B> The activity tab panel shows information about the person's current activity.
<P>The person's current job speciality is shown at the top.  You can change the person's job with the drop-down menu.  The person will
  remain in that job speciality in the simulation until you change it again.
<P>The person's current task is displayed below, along with the task phase.
<P>The person's current mission (if any) is displayed at the bottom, along with the mission phase.
<P>At the right of the mission display are the mission and monitor icons.  Clicking the mission icon will open the Mission tool and select the
