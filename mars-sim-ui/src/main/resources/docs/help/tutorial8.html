<H2>Tutorial - Step 8: Preferences Tool</H2>
<P>The Preferences Tool lets you control some overall settings in MSP. The controls should be more or less self-explanatory, but here is an overview:</P>
<P>The Mute button mutes MSP, but not your computers main sound output. The Volume slider just below lets you adjust MSP sound effect volume.</P>
<P>Native Look &amp; Feel lets MSP use your operating systems built-in user interface design ('Look and Feel') instead of the one supplied with Java. This will give you a more integrated user experience, but may look odd in some cases.</P>
<P>Show Unit Toolbar and Show Toolbar shows or hides the respective bars, giving you a little more screen real estate if needed.</P>
