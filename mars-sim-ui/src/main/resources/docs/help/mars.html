<H2>Mars</H2>
<P>The 4th planet from the Sun, <B>Mars</B> is unsurprisingly the red planet that Mars Simulation Project unfolds on. It has two satellites or moons - <A HREF="phobos.html">Phobos</A> and <A HREF="deimos.html">Deimos</A>.</P>
<P>Mars is both smaller and less dense than Earth, and owes its orange-red hue to ferric oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</P>
The total mass of Mars is around 6.4185Ã—10<sup>23</sup> kg, or about a tenth of Earth's.
<P>The atmosphere is composed mostly of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), accounting for 95.32% of the total atmosphere. While unbreathable by humans, this is utilized in some of the settlements' processes.</P>
