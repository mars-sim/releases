<P>The Science tool displays information about ongoing and finished scientific studies.</P>
<P>The top left list shows all ongoing studies and their current phase of completion.  Phases for a study are "Study Proposal", 
"Collaborator Invitation", "Research", "Writing Paper", and "Peer Review" in chronological order.  You can select a study and
its information will be displayed in the study details panel on the right.</P>
<P>The bottom left list shows all finished studies and their completion status.  A study can have "Successful Completion", 
"Failed Completion", or "Canceled" status.  Successful Completion means that the study was fully completed and passed peer 
review.  Failed Completion means that the study was fully completed but failed peer review.  Canceled means that the study was
canceled before completion, perhaps due to death of the primary researcher.  You can select a study and its information will be 
displayed in the study details panel on the right.</P>
<P>The Study Details panel shows information about the selected scientific study.</P>
<P>The top panel displays general information about the study.  Study Science shows the scientific field that the study primarily focuses on.
The Difficulty Level shows the difficulty and importance of the study.  It is determined by the primary researcher's skill level in the study 
science at the time the study is proposed.  The Status line shows the studies current phase or completion status.</P>
<P>The primary researcher panel shows a button with the study's primary researcher's name.  Clicking on it opens an information dialog for 
the researcher.  The Scientific Field line shows what scientific field the researcher is focused on for the study.  If the study is ongoing,
the next line shows the researchers current study activity with a progress bar showing the current progress in work or time for that activity.
If the study is finished, the line shows the scientific achievement credit earned by the researcher for the study.  Only successfully completed
studies will earn scientific achievement credit for researchers.</P>
<P>A scientific study may have up to three collaborating researchers, each displayed in a panel below the primary researcher's panel.  A 
collaborative researcher panel shows a button with the collaborator's name.  Clicking on it opens an information dialog for 
the researcher.  The Scientific Field line shows what scientific field the researcher is focused on for the study.  If the study is ongoing,
the next line shows the researchers current study activity with a progress bar showing the current progress in work or time for that activity.
If the study is finished, the line shows the scientific achievement credit earned by the researcher for the study.  Only successfully completed
studies will earn scientific achievement credit for researchers.</P>
