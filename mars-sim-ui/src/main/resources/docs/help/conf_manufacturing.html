<P>The manufacturing.xml configuration file contains configuration for manufacturing processes that can be performed by 
 settlers in manufacturing buildings. Manufacturing processes can be added, edited, or deleted.</P>
<P>A "malfunction" element has the following attributes: "name", "tech", "skill", "work-time", and "process-time". The 
 "name" attribute has to be a unique name for the process. The "tech" attribute is the minimum manufacturing building tech 
 level required for the process. The "skill" attribute is the minimum materials science skill required for a settler to
 start or work on the process. The "work-time" attribute is the total amount of effective work time (millisols) 
 (See <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>) required to complete the process. The "process-time" attribute is the total
 amount of time (millisols) (See <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>) required for the process to be completed.</P>
<P>The "malfunction" element has the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>inputs:</B> This is a list of input materials required for the process. The inputs element is required, but there
 can be zero to many child elements of the following types:
    <UL>
      <LI><B>resource:</B> The resource element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource 
   (See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">resources.xml</A>). The "amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the 
    resource (kilograms) needed.</LI>
      <LI><B>part:</B> The part element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file 
    (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>). The "number" attribute is the number of parts required.</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI><B>outputs:</B> This is a list of output materials produced by the process. The outputs element is required, but there
  can be zero to many child elements of the following types:
    <UL>
      <LI><B>resource:</B> The resource element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource 
   (See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">resources.xml</A>). The "amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the 
    resource (kilograms) produced.</LI>
      <LI><B>part:</B> The part element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file 
    (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>). The "number" attribute is the number of parts produced.</LI>
      <LI><B>equipment:</B> The equipment element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a supported type of equipment
    in the simulation (as of version 2.86, currently supported equipment are: "bag", "gas canister", "barrel", 
    "specimen container", and "eva suit". The "number" attribute is the number of equipment produced.</LI>
      <LI><B>vehicle:</B> The vehicle element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a vehicle type listed in the 
   conf/vehicles.xml file (See <A HREF="conf_vehicles.html">vehicles.xml</A>). The "number" attribute is the number 
    of vehicles produced.</LI>
