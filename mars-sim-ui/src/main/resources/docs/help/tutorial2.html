<H2>Tutorial - Step 2: The Main Simulation Window</H2>
<P>The Main Simulation Window is the large window which forms the base of the simulation. It has a reddish background texture, a menu bar, a tool bar, and a bottom bar which lists open unit windows - although none are open initially. It can also contain a multitude of tool windows.</P>
<P>Upon start of a new simulation, you will see one tool window already open: the Mars Navigator. We'll cover that one in Step 4 after we have a look at the menus.</P>
