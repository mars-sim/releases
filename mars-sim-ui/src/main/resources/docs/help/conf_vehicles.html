<P>The vehicles.xml configuration file contains configuration for the vehicles in the simulation.</P>
<P>The "vehicle" element defines a type of vehicle.  Each vehicle must have a unique "type" attribute that is used to refer to it in other
  configuration files.  Vehicles have the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>fuel-efficiency:</B> This is the fuel efficiency (km/kg) of the vehicle.  Rovers currently use methane as fuel.  This is a required
    element.</LI>
  <LI><B>base-speed:</B> This is the normal top speed (km/hr) of the vehicle.  This is a required element.</LI>
  <LI><B>empty-mass:</B> This is the mass (kg) of the vehicle when it is unloaded.  This is a required element.</LI>
  <LI><B>crew-size:</B> This is the maximum number of people the vehicle can hold.  This is a required element.</LI>
  <LI><B>cargo:</B> This is the cargo capacity list for the vehicle.  The "total-capacity" element is the total mass (kg) of cargo the vehicle
    can hold.  Each "capacity" element has a "resource" attribute that must be a valid resource (see <A HREF="conf_resources.html">resources.xml</A>).
    The "value" attribute is the mass (kg) of that resource the vehicle can hold.</LI>
  <LI><B>sickbay:</B> This is the vehicle's sickbay.  The "tech-level" attribute is the treatment technology level of the sickbay 
  (see <A HREF="conf_tech_level.html">Tech Levels</A>).  The "beds" attribute is the number of beds in the sickbay.  This is an 
    optional element and its absence means that the vehicle doesn't have a sickbay.</LI>
  <LI><B>lab:</B> This is the vehicle's laboratory.  The "tech-level" attribute is the technology level of the laboratory 
  (see <A HREF="conf_tech_level.html">Tech Levels</A>).  There is a child element for each technology speciality of the lab.  
    The "tech-speciality" elements must have a value of one of the currently supported research areas: "Areology", "Botany", "Construction", 
    or "Medicine".  
    This element is optional and its absence indicates that the vehicle doesn't have a laboratory.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The "rover-name-list" element is a list of rover names that is randomly selected from when rovers are created for the simulation.</P>
<P>Each "rover-name" element must have a unique "value" attribute.</P>
