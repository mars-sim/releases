<H2>Backstory</H2>
<P><TT>It is the year 2043. Humanity has undertaken a massive international effort to explore and colonize Mars. Functional colonies are in place, and the settlers are hard at work making a society work in this new world, on this new continent.</TT></P>
<P><TT>Mars is a hostile environment, but you have skilled professionals at your disposal.
Tending greenhouses, making scientific studies, driving rovers... and sometimes recovering from burns or anxiety attacks...</TT></P>
<P>Mars Simulation Project is more of a social what-if experiment than a classic game with a linear storyline or a set of rigidly defined goals. Of course you will want your settlers to survive, but there are no badges or awards other than the joy of progressing with the exploration and colonization of Mars.</P>
<P>It is a social simulation, modeling the human behavior of scientists, engineers, doctors, technicians, etc. as they go about their day-to-day lives in the virtual Martian environment. There are many different settlements spread out across the planet, ranging from simple 4-person initial landing habitats to more mature bases hosting dozens of people and advanced buildings. The settlers spend much of their time maintaining their settlements, growing crops in their greenhouses, and manufacturing needed parts and equipment from collected local resources. They also go out on rover missions to explore and study the surrounding area, prospect and mine mineral concentrations, and trade with their neighboring settlements.</P>
<P>Mars is a harsh and dangerous world, and the settlers have to contend with accidents, equipment malfunctions, illnesses, injuries, and even death. Survival depends on the settlers working together, building relationships, improving skills and balancing the needs of their settlements.</P>
<P>This is an openly-developed project and we welcome anyone who would like to contribute code, artwork, sounds, or simply ideas and feedback.<P>
