<H2>Simulation Configuration Editor</H2>
<P>The Simulation Configuration Editor allows you to configure a new simulation before it's created and started.</P>
<P>The dialog has a table of settlements to be created in the new simulation.  The table is initially populated with a default set of settlements.</P>
<P>The settlement table shows the settlement's name, template, latitude and longitude.  Each of these fields can edited by clicking or double clicking on them.  
If a field is changed to an invalid value, a red error message appears below the table and the Create New Simulation button is disabled until it is fixed.</P>
<P>The Add button will add a new settlement with a random configuration to the table.</P>
<P>The Remove button will remove any selected settlements from the table.</P>
<P>The Default button will reset the default settlements on the table, clearing any changes.</P>
<P>The Create New Simulation button will close the dialog, create and start a new simulation with the configured settlements.</P>
