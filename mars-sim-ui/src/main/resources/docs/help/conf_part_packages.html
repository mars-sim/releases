<P>The part_packages.xml configuration file defines packages of parts that can be used for initial settlement supplies and resupply missions.</P>
<P>The "part-package-list" element is a list of all part packages used in the simulation.</P>
<P>The "part-package" element defines an individual part package.  It has a unique "name" attribute. It contains a list of "part" elements 
  representing parts contained in the package.</P>
<P>Each part element must have a "type" attribute that matches a part type (see <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).  The "number" 
  attribute is the number of this type of part contained in the part package.</P>
