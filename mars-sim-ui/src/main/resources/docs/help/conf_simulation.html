<P>The simulation.xml configuration file contains configuration for the simulation. At the moment we only have time-related configuration
 for the simulation, but we expect additional configuration here later.</P>
<P>The "time-configuration" element is a group of time-related configuration elements. It has the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>time-ratio:</B> This element is the ratio between simulation-time and real-time. For example, if its value is "1000.0", time in the
 simulation moves 1000 times faster than in the real world.</LI>
  <LI><B>earth-start-date-time:</B> This element is the starting time of the simulation in Earth-time. The format is "MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss". </LI>
  <LI><B>mars-start-date-time:</B> This element is the starting time of the simulation in Mars-time. The format is in 
 "orbit-month-sol:millisol" (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>).</LI>
