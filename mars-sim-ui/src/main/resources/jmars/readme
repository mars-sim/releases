hi.

these files were downloaded using the jmars webservices of arizona
state university's mars space flight facility and are intended to be
used to generally improve realism of the simulation, if anyone has
any ideas on how to use them.

source urls:

http://ms-mars.mars.asu.edu/?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&FORMAT=image/png&SRS=JMARS:1,180.0,90.0&STYLES=&VERSION=1.1.1&LAYERS=<maplayer>&WIDTH=<xsize>&HEIGHT=<ysize>&BBOX=-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0

replace <xsize> with desired horizontal pixel resolution
replace <ysize> with desired vertical pixel resolution
replace <maplayer> with either
MOLA_128ppd_shade_ne or
viking_geologic_map_skinner_et_al_2006 or
any other valid map layer name.

best way to access those and other maps of mars is jmars, an open
source tool for "Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing",
which can be downloaded as executable jars or source code from:

https://jmars.mars.asu.edu/
