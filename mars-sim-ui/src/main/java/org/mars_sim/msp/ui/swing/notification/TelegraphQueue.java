	/**
	 * This method works like the join() method on a thread. It allows to wait
	 * for the whole queue to be processed by keeping its thread alive. You can
	 * use it easily by calling it after adding elements in the queue:
	 * 
	 * @code TelegraphQueue q = new TelegraphQueue(); q.add(new
	 *       Telegraph("title","description"); q.add(new
	 *       Telegraph("title","description"); q.add(new
	 *       Telegraph("title","description"); q.join();
	 * @code
	 * 
	 *       Following this example, the 3 telegraphs will be displayed one by
	 *       one, and the program will end properly at the end of the third
	 *       telegraph. Without the {@link #join()} method, the programs ends
	 *       directly after the third add() execution, without displaying
	 *       properly the telegraphs. Have a look at the unit tests and remove
	 *       the {@link #join()} call to see the difference.
