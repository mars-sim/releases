** Installation **

This Java application requires a Java 2 virtual machine.  The latest
JVM can be downloaded from Sun at:
    http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.3/jre/

1) Unzip MarsProject_X.XX.zip (where XXX is the version number)
   ie. "unzip MarsProject_2.65.zip"

2) Run the Installer application
      "java Installer"
   
   If the Installer application fails from lack of memory or is exceedingly
   slow, you may wish to download the uncompressed data files instead.
   http://mars-sim.sourceforge.net/SurfaceDat.zip   (5.4Mb)
   http://mars-sim.sourceforge.net/TopoDat.zip      (4.7Mb)
   Just unzip these files into you application directory.

3) Start the Mars Simulation Project
      "java MarsProject"
