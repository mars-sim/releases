	crops should work like manufacturing processes:
	they take inputs (co², water, energy...),
	produce outputs (food, biomass, fiber for construction, o² for breathing...),
	need fixed time,
	need work time (of botanist or biologist),
	need a building tech level,
	and botany/biology skill level,
	and are maybe sensitive to pressure, temperature, radiation, daylength/night, atmospheric composition, ...
	
	for example:

		<crop-process	name="algae blooming"
						growing-time="21.0"
						work-time="0.5"
						biology-skill-required="1"
						botany-skill-required="0"
						building-tech-level="2">
			<description>uses a few seeding algae to produce a lot more algae.</description>
			<input-item-list>
				<input name="carbon dioxide" amount="19.0"/>
				<input name="water" amount="120.0"/>
				<input name="algae" amount="1.0"/>
			</input-item-list>
			<output-item-list>
				<output name="oxygen" amount="20.0"/>
				<output name="water" amount="20.0"/>
				<output name="algae" amount="100.0"/>
			</output-item-list>
		</crop-process>
		<crop-process name="algae paste cooking"
						cooking-skill-required="1"
						biology-skill-required="1">
			<input-item-list>
				<input name="algae" amount="50.0"/>
			</input-item-list>
			<output-item-list>
				<output name="food" amount="20.0"/>
			</output-item-list>
		</crop-process>
		
		that way, wouldnt need special crop list,
		just add more resources like algae or fungi
		and add more manufacturing processes with
		special required skills and buildings
